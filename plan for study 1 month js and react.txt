plan for study 1 month js and react : We'll go React + JavaScript together — you can't learn one well without the other.

🔁 Format for each day:
📘 Theory (~1–2 hours)

🧪 Hands-on/practice (~1 hour)

✍️ Build something (~1 hour)

✅ Week 1: Core JavaScript + React Basics
Day	Topics
1	✅ Done! React Router + useState Basics
2	JavaScript variables, data types, functions; useEffect in React
3	JavaScript arrays & methods (map, filter, etc.); React rendering
4	Event handling, DOM, and conditional rendering in React
5	props, props drilling, and component communication
6	JavaScript objects, destructuring, spread/rest; useState with arrays/objects
7	Mini Project 1 (e.g. Todo App, Counter App)

✅ Week 2: React Deeper + Async JS
useEffect in depth

Lifecycle logic

fetch, Promises, async/await

Error handling

Component patterns (lifting state up)

Form handling (controlled inputs)

✅ Week 3: Hooks & App Structure
Custom hooks (useFetch, useCounter)

useRef, useMemo, useCallback

Routing with params

Component folder structure

Context API

React DevTools usage

✅ Week 4: API, Auth & Deployment
Use external API (e.g. News API, OpenWeather)

Simple Auth (login form + token storage)

Add animations (Framer Motion)

Build 1-page portfolio

Deploy with Vercel/Netlify

🔁 Daily Routine Suggestion
Start with 1 JavaScript concept

Then apply it inside a small React component

Build something small daily (form, counter, card, etc.)

Push to GitHub at least 3x/week

✅ For Tomorrow (Day 2 Suggestion)
Topics:

JavaScript: functions, parameters, return values, arrow functions, scope

React: useEffect, initial rendering, dependency array

Practice: Use useEffect with a timer (setInterval) or fetch dummy data
